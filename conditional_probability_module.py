# Formula used to calculate conditional probability:
# P(language|company)= P(language âˆ© company) / P(company)
#                    = (co-occurrences of language with company/total profiles) / (occurrences of company/total profiles) 
#                    = co-occurrences of language with company / occurrences of company
